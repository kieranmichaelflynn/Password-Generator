#<Password Generator>

##Description

- My task was to create JavaScript code to add to an online password generator so that I could randomly produce a password based on user inputed criteria
- I was motivated by the idea of using JavaScript in such a way to be functional and accessible to users, and to be able to make complex operations simple
- This is my first real test with using JavaScript and I have enjoyed the challenge and greatly expanded my knowledge and understanding of JavaScript
- This website will prove to be the base of a greater ability and understanding of JavaScript to come
